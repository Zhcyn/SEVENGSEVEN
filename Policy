This is a sample code for converting and searching Japanese strings, allowing the options to be changed to find the exact text contained in Katakana, Hiragana, or both.
The current project is still under development, and the current stage is mainly to test the correctness of the conversion and the integrity of the interface.
If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me.
